## Introduction to InsightHR

### Overview

InsightHR is a serverless application designed to help businesses, especially in IT and related fields, customize and automate their HR evaluation and management processes. The application not only visualizes performance data but also provides a flexible platform for each company to apply their unique set of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and evaluation formulas, enabling accurate and fair HR decisions.

### The Problem We Solve

In modern enterprises, particularly in the technology sector where roles and performance metrics are highly diverse, personnel evaluation often:

- **Consumes significant time** with manual processes
- **Suffers from subjectivity** and bias
- **Lacks flexibility** due to rigid, one-size-fits-all tools
- **Fails to adapt** to unique company cultures and objectives

### Our Solution

InsightHR transforms HR management by providing:

#### 1. Customizable KPIs
Define your own performance indicators that matter to your organization, from technical metrics like code quality to soft skills like teamwork.

#### 2. Flexible Scoring Formulas
Build custom evaluation formulas using your defined KPIs with adjustable weights, ensuring evaluations align with your company's values and priorities.

#### 3. Automated Processing
Upload performance data and let the system automatically calculate scores based on your custom formulas, eliminating manual calculations and reducing errors.

#### 4. Visual Dashboards
Track performance across individuals, teams, and departments with intuitive charts and graphs, making it easy to identify trends and patterns.

#### 5. AI-Powered Insights
Query your HR data using natural language through an intelligent chatbot assistant powered by Amazon Bedrock, making data analysis accessible to everyone.

#### 6. Automated Notifications
Keep employees informed with automatic notifications for performance milestones, review reminders, and important updates via Amazon SNS.
